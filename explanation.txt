While this might appear to be a worthless webpage, this is something I've felt needed to be done. When I used to have time to play videogames with my friends, Minecraft was a frequent fall-back game. Having played it for years, I've grown quite bored with the game. This is where mods come in. A tiny QoL mod here, a major overhaul mod there , and you're playing an entirely different game!

However, I had to learn how to set everything up myself. Years ago, this was no easy task. Different mods had different requirements and conflicts. Each issue needed manual resolving, only offering hints as to what might have gone wrong in the form of vauge tracebacks. It was a dark time.

If I managed to get the game to run, then came the truely difficult part: Running a server that can work over the internet. While there are many hosting services available, none of these were an option for me as a child. Each service charging a decent sum per month while I was stuck at my desk, penniless. There was another solution, however. By using my own computer to host the server, I could feasibly manage the server all on my own. This is where the real roadblock rears its head. The internet is a scary place and it doesn't like making things easy.

While guides online try to simplify the ordeal, most only focus on handling mod conflicts and requirements. When it came to running the server itself they would most frequently refer readers to a hosting service, stating that hosting the server itself was out of the scope of the guide. This is where I come in. I want to make a complete guide to setting up a local server along with setting up connections to non-local computers. For my guide, I want to follow the styling of https://hacks.guide for my guide. I've used these guides before for projects of mine and found them consice and easy to read.
