                        You can expect a consistent experience and great reliability for a small cost per month the server is running. Realms has one major downside: It does not, at the present time, support mods. Datapacks however, work as intended.

                        A complete guide on using a hosting service to manage your Minecraft server for you. This offers more customization and control, but comes at the cost of difficulty.

                        While each service is different, prices can range anywhere from free to hundreds of dollars each month. That choice is up to you and what your needs are expected to be.

                        These services often provide their own control panel and unique ways to manage mods that the server uses.

                            If you are okay with that responsibility, keep note that running a Minecraft server and playing Minecraft on the same machine is possible, but require a powerful system.
