                This guide is more of a proof-of-concept, being built for a class assignment. As such, bits and bobs within the website might not work as intended. Without external help, it is also possible that information here and there might fall out of date. If that is the case, please do not hesitate to send me an email or other message to let me know! I would appreciate the help.

                I often had trouble remembering the exact steps I needed to take when setting up Minecraft servers for my friends and I to use. How do I go about installing mods? Which version of Forge do I need? What the heck is a Fabric? If it wasn’t obvious from my writing in the guides, I haven’t explored newer versions of the game in quite some time. I still find Java edition 1.12.2 new and exciting! Crazy how the game is already nearing version 1.17 at the time of writing this. I wanted to make this guide, offering step-by-step instructions for people whether they were working on their hundredth server or if they were making a modded server for the very first time. It felt like every guide I went to was only providing instuctions for some hosting service’s product.
