                Definitely the more complex of options, hosting services come in many forms. Don’t let this intimidate you! Many companies offer their own solutions on how to manage, run, and operate a server. Services such as Hostinger, Shockbyte, BisectHosting, GG Servers, and APEX Hosting, all provide server hosting cappabilities as a service. Some hosts even offer a low-power free version, too! Picking between hosts is left to the reader’s discretion, as each provider has unique pros and cons that differentiate them from the competition.

                Hosting services, hereafter reffered to as hosts, typically have their own guides on how to go about configuring modded Minecraft servers. Instead of explaining how to go about setting up each possible host’s servers, instead we will just discuss the options available to you.

                Minecraft comes in two major editions. The “classic” version is the Java edition, having a wider range of mod options and a long history of mod compatibility, many stick with it through thick and thin. Bedrock edition is the younger brother to Java edition, starting as a port of Minecraft Pocket Edition (PE) for smart phones, Bedrock offers a narrower selection of mods, simply due to its younger age. Bedrock edition provides a different feel to the Minecraft experience, Mojang tweaking how elements play out to better fit the playerbase. Chosing which edition to play on comes down to personal preference at the end of the day. If you already know which version you plan on using, simply select it from the two options down below.
