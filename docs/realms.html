                Minecraft Realms is a Mojang-hosted private server. This means you and your friends have a private world for you all to play together. Mojang does not offer this service for free, however. As the hosting and management is offered as a service, Mojang expects $7.99/month as payment. There are several payment options to handle this, from a monthly subscription or a single bulk payment up front, at a slight discount.

                Realms is offered both for Minecraft Java Edition and Minecraft Bedrock. The choice on which version is up to you, as each version has pros and cons. It is important to note that Bedrock players can only play on Bedrock servers while Java players can only play on Java Servers. Another downside of Realms is the lack of mod support. If you wanted to run a modded Minecraft Server, you need to find another solution. However, the game experience can still be modified through the use of datapacks. The use of datapacks is out of the scope of this guide, but other sources on the internet are available for that information.

                Now for the big decision you need to make: Will you be running Java or Bedrock edition? This will likely just be whichever version you own, but it plays an important role in what you will need to do. If you know which version you will be using, simply click the corresponding box below.
